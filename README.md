# VBA-Challenge
**Project Overview**

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol,
yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,
the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,
the total stock volume of the stock, and the
results were uploaded to GitHub.

**Resources and Challenges**
The biggest challenge I ran into with the code was making it loop through all of the worksheets, activating the worksheet, and saving the file, primarily. I kept getting an alert every time I tried to save my file which made it impossible to upload to GitHub and submit the assignment. In order to solve the problem, I just repasted my code into a new, unedited version of the excel file provided to us. I used a lot of resources such as my group, Stack Overflow, office hours, and the AskBCS tutor.
